    "Bayes's theorem is a fundamental concept in probability theory that describes how to update the probability of a hypothesis based on new evidence. It's named after the Reverend Thomas Bayes, who formulated the theorem. The theorem is expressed as:\n",

    "- \\( P(A) \\) is the prior probability of hypothesis A being true (prior probability).\n",
    "- \\( P(B) \\) is the probability of observing evidence B (normalizing constant).\n",
    "\n",
    "Bayes's theorem allows us to update our belief about the likelihood of a hypothesis being true in light of new evidence. Let's illustrate this with an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "Suppose we have a medical test to detect a certain disease, and the disease is quite rare, occurring in only 1% of the population. The test is quite accurate, with a 95% true positive rate (sensitivity) and a 90% true negative rate (specificity).\n",

    "\\[ P(B) = 0.1085 \\]\n",

    "\\[ P(A|B) ≈ 0.0876 \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "So, even with a positive test result, the probability of actually having the disease is only around 8.76%. This example illustrates how Bayes's theorem helps update our belief about the likelihood of a hypothesis (having the disease) given new evidence (positive test result)."

    "A confidence interval is a range of values derived from sample data that is likely to contain the true population parameter with a certain level of confidence. It provides a measure of the uncertainty or precision associated with estimating population parameters from sample data.\n",
    "\n",

    "1. **Select a Confidence Level**: Determine the desired level of confidence, typically expressed as a percentage (e.g., 95% confidence level).\n",

    "\n",
    "4. **Construct the Confidence Interval**: Using the sample statistic (e.g., sample mean or proportion) and the margin of error, construct the confidence interval by adding and subtracting the margin of error from the sample statistic.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's illustrate with an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "Suppose we want to estimate the average height of students in a school. We randomly select 50 students and measure their heights. The sample mean height is 65 inches, and the sample standard deviation is 3 inches.\n",

    "2. **Choose a Statistical Distribution**: Since the sample size is relatively large (n = 50), we can use the normal distribution.\n",

    "3. **Calculate the Margin of Error**:\n",
    "   - Determine the critical value from the standard normal distribution corresponding to a 95% confidence level. For a 95% confidence level, the critical z-value is approximately 1.96.\n",
    "   - Calculate the standard error of the sample mean: \\( \\frac{{\\text{Sample Standard Deviation}}}{{\\sqrt{\\text{Sample Size}}}} \\).\n",
    "   - Calculate the margin of error: \\( \\text{Margin of Error} = \\text{Critical Value} \\times \\text{Standard Error} \\).\n",
    "\n",
    "   For our example:\n",
    "   - Standard Error \\( = \\frac{3}{\\sqrt{50}} ≈ 0.4243 \\)\n",
    "   - Margin of Error \\( ≈ 1.96 \\times 0.4243 ≈ 0.8316 \\)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Construct the Confidence Interval**:\n",
    "   - Lower Limit \\( = \\text{Sample Mean} - \\text{Margin of Error} ≈ 65 - 0.8316 ≈ 64.1684 \\)\n",
    "   - Upper Limit \\( = \\text{Sample Mean} + \\text{Margin of Error} ≈ 65 + 0.8316 ≈ 65.8316 \\)\n",
    "\n",
    "So, the 95% confidence interval for the average height of students in the school is approximately 64.17 inches to 65.83 inches. This means that we are 95% confident that the true average height of all students in the school falls within this range."
